Introduction
======================================================================

The Whiley programming language employs the extended static checking
to eliminate the errors at the compile time, and compiles the
high-level Whiley program into different kinds of implementations.
However, the C implementations that the Whiley compiler generates are
currently quite inefficient, due to always using unbounded integers,
unbounded data structures with frequent copying, etc. This project
aims to use the program analysis techniques to generate efficient
parallel implementations in C and OpenCL and to gain the speed-up
across heterogeneous platforms.

Installation
======================================================================

1. The Whiley Intermediate Language Interpreter (WyIL Interpreter)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To run WyIL interpreter on command line, please follow the below steps.
% ant
% cd examples
% ./../bin/wyopcl sieve.whiley

Or enable the verbose option to print out the interpretation:
% ./../bin/wyopcl -verbose sieve.whiley

2. Whiley-to-OpenCL translator
The Whiley-to-OpenCL translator is written in Java and aims to generate
C/OpenCL code and proof obligation. At this stage, we will use the prime
example as the main test case (perhaps we need more) to manually generate
its OpenCL code and produce the proof obligations in SMT syntax, which
allows us to make use of different SMT solvers (e.g. Z3).
