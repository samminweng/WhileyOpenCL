==3588==     Valgrind's memory management: out of memory:
==3588==        newSuperblock's request for 588951552 bytes failed.
==3588==        18744123392 bytes have already been allocated.
==3588==     Valgrind cannot continue.  Sorry.
==3588== 
==3588==     There are several possible reasons for this.
==3588==     - You have some kind of memory limit in place.  Look at the
==3588==       output of 'ulimit -a'.  Is there a limit on the size of
==3588==       virtual memory or address space?
==3588==     - You have run out of swap space.
==3588==     - Valgrind has a bug.  If you think this is the case or you are
==3588==     not sure, please let us know and we'll try to fix it.
==3588==     Please note that programs can take substantially more memory than
==3588==     normal when running under Valgrind tools, eg. up to twice or
==3588==     more, depending on the tool.  On a 64-bit machine, Valgrind
==3588==     should be able to make use of up 32GB memory.  On a 32-bit
==3588==     machine, Valgrind should be able to use all the memory available
==3588==     to a single process, up to 4GB if that's how you have your
==3588==     kernel configured.  Most 32-bit Linux setups allow a maximum of
==3588==     3GB per process.
==3588== 
==3588==     Whatever the reason, Valgrind cannot continue.  Sorry.
