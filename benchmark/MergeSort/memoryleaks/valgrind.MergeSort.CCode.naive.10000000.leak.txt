==3459==     Valgrind's memory management: out of memory:
==3459==        newSuperblock's request for 65536 bytes failed.
==3459==        18769223680 bytes have already been allocated.
==3459==     Valgrind cannot continue.  Sorry.
==3459== 
==3459==     There are several possible reasons for this.
==3459==     - You have some kind of memory limit in place.  Look at the
==3459==       output of 'ulimit -a'.  Is there a limit on the size of
==3459==       virtual memory or address space?
==3459==     - You have run out of swap space.
==3459==     - Valgrind has a bug.  If you think this is the case or you are
==3459==     not sure, please let us know and we'll try to fix it.
==3459==     Please note that programs can take substantially more memory than
==3459==     normal when running under Valgrind tools, eg. up to twice or
==3459==     more, depending on the tool.  On a 64-bit machine, Valgrind
==3459==     should be able to make use of up 32GB memory.  On a 32-bit
==3459==     machine, Valgrind should be able to use all the memory available
==3459==     to a single process, up to 4GB if that's how you have your
==3459==     kernel configured.  Most 32-bit Linux setups allow a maximum of
==3459==     3GB per process.
==3459== 
==3459==     Whatever the reason, Valgrind cannot continue.  Sorry.
