Package Summary
======================================================================

wyc/ ---- The compiler front-end, including all code for the lexer,
          the parser, the raw AST, and various tools for instantiating
          and configuring a Whiley Compiler.

wyil/ --- The Whiley Intermediate Language (wyil).  The Whiley
          Compiler (wyc) converts Whiley programs into this
          intermediate language, and then various transforms are
          applied.  The wyil constitutes a bytecode (similar, in some
          ways, to Java Bytecode) which can be interpreted and
          executed on its own (if desired).  This package includes
          code for performing type checking, constant propagation, and
          various other manipulations.  Furthermore, all the necessary
          code for manipulating structural types in Whiley is included
          here.  In short, this package constitutes the bulk of the
          compiler.

wyjc/ --- The Whiley-to-Java Compiler.  This extends the Whiley
          Compiler (wyc) with additional transforms for converting
          wyil code into Java bytecode.

wyrt/ --- The Whiley Standard Library.  This provides the core
          implementation for the standard library.  All architecture
          specific code is omitted and, instead, is stored within the
          respective back-end module (e.g. wyjc).
