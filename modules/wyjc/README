Package Summary
======================================================================

src/wyjc/ --- The Whiley-to-Java Compiler.  This extends the Whiley
              Compiler (wyc) with additional transforms for converting
              wyil code into Java bytecode.

src/wyjvm/ -- The Whiley JVM library.  This library is used for
              generating valid Java bytecode.  It abstracts the
              various bytecodes and their different forms and takes
              care of their optimal translation into actual JVM
              bytecodes.  In addition, it handles various annoying
              aspects of Java bytecode, such as ensuring wide branches
              are used when necessary.  Finally, passes are provided
              for eliminating dead-code and santity checking the
              generated bytecode.

src/whiley/ - The native Java components of the standard library.
