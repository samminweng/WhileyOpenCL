// -x2 * v1 <= x1 + x2 * xs 
//  y2 * v2 >= -y1 - (y2 * xs)

//
// -x2 * y2 * v1 <= y2 * (x1 + x2 * xs)
// -x2 * y2 * v2 >= -x2 * (-y1 - (y2 * xs))
//
// At this point, the left-hand side of both of the above inequalities
// identical, and we can safely apply transitivity.  Since we've multipled 
// through by -x2 and y2 we need to check that x > 0.0 and y > 0.0, 
// otherwise we would need to reverse the signs and the inference wouldn't succeed.
