Package Summary
======================================================================

src/wyil/ --- The Whiley Intermediate Language (wyil).  The Whiley
              Compiler (wyc) converts Whiley programs into this
              intermediate language, and then various transforms are
              applied.  The wyil constitutes a bytecode (similar, in
              some ways, to Java Bytecode) which can be interpreted
              and executed on its own (if desired).  This package
              includes code for performing type checking, constant
              propagation, and various other manipulations.
              Furthermore, all the necessary code for manipulating
              structural types in Whiley is included here.  In short,
              this package constitutes the bulk of the compiler.
         
src/wyautl/ - The Whiley Automata Library.  This library is used for
              representing and manipulating finite tree automata.
              These automata are used as the underlying representation
              of types in Whiley, and there are a number of relatively
              complex algorithms required to manipulate them.  For
              example, for representing automatas in canonical form.
