/**
 * <p>
 * The explicit coercion operator extends the implicit coercion operator to
 * include coercions which must be specified with an explicit cast operation.
 * This is necessary because such coercions correspond to a loss of precision
 * and, hence, may fail at runtime. An example is the following
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * char f(int x):
 *     return (char) x
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The above will only compile if the explicit <code>(char)</code> cast is
 * provided. This is required because a <code>char</code> corresponds only to a
 * subset of the possible integers (i.e. those codepoints defined by the Unicode
 * standard). The semantics of the Whiley language dictate that, should the
 * integer lie outside the range of permissible code points, then a runtime
 * fault is raised.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <b>NOTE:</b> as for the subtype operator, both types must have been
 * normalised beforehand to guarantee correct results from this operator. </p>
 *
