/**
 * <p>
 * Represents a path through the body of a Wyil method or function. A branch
 * accumulates the constraints known to hold through that particular execution
 * path. These constraints can then be checked for satisfiability at various
 * critical points in the function (i.e. by generating verification conditions).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When verifying a given function or method, the verifier starts with a single
 * branch at the beginning of the method. When split points in the control-flow
 * graph are encountered, branches are accordingly forked off to represent the
 * alternate control-flow path. At control-flow meet points, branches may also
 * be joined back together (although this is not always strictly necessary). A
 * diagrammatic view might be:

 *   ||//  \\
 *   ##/   ||
 *   ||    ||
 *   \/    \/
 *   B1    B3
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In the above example, we initially start with one branch <code>B1</code>.
 * This is then forked to give branch <code>B2</code> which, in turn, is forked
 * again to give <code>B3</code>. Subsequently, branch <code>B2</code> is joined
 * back with <code>B1</code>. However, <code>B3</code> is never joined and
 * terminates separately.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Every branch (except the first) has one or more <i>parent</i> branches which
 * it was either forked or joined from. Given any two branches there is always a
 * <i>Least Common Ancestor (LCA)</i> --- that is, the latest point which is
 * common to both branches. Finding the LCA can be useful, for example, to
 * identify constraints common to both branches.

	 * a new variable to store the value from each branch. The following
	 * illustrates the two patched environments (which are children of the two
	 * above):
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * Branch 3:   Branch 4:
	 * parent: 1   parent: 2
	 * 
	 * |0|1|2|3|   |0|1|2|3|
	 * =========   =========
	 * |X|W|Z|/|   |X|W|/|/|
	 * 
	 * (W == Y)    (W == Z)
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Below the patched branches we can see the constraints which have been
	 * assumed to ensure information from both branches is correctly retained.
	 * The finaly joined branch is thus:

	 * <pre>

	 * parents: 3,4
	 * 
	 * |0|1|2|3|
	 * =========
	 * |X|W|/|/|
