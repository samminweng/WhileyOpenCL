/**
 * <p>
 * A finite-state automaton for representing Whiley types. This is a machine for
 * accepting matching inputs of a given language. An automaton is a directed
 * graph whose nodes and edges are referred to as <i>states</i> and
 * <i>transitions</i>. Each state has a "kind" which determines how the state
 * behaves on given inputs. For example, a state with "OR" kind might accept an
 * input if either of its children does; in contrast, and state of "AND" kind
 * might accept an input only if all its children does.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The organisation of children is done according to two approaches:
 * <i>deterministic</i> and <i>non-deterministic</i>. In the deterministic
 * approach, the ordering of children is important; in the non-deterministic
 * approach, the ordering of children is not important. A flag is used to
 * indicate whether a state is deterministic or not.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Aside from having a particular kind, each state may also have supplementary
 * material. This can be used, for example, to effectively provide labelled
 * transitions. Another use of this might be to store a given string which must
 * be matched.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> In the internal representation of automata, leaf states may be
 * not be represented as actual nodes. This will occur if the leaf node does not
 * include any supplementary data, and is primarily for space and performance
 * optimisation. In such case, the node is represented as a child node using a
 * negative index.
 * </p>
