/**
 * <p>
 * Responsible for writing an automaton in a binary format to an output stream.
 * Obviously, it cannot know how to handle the supplementary data that can be
 * provided as part of a state. Therefore, if the automaton contains states
 * which have supplementary data, the client is expected to deal with this.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> By default, this class completely ignores any supplementary
 * data. To allow writing this data, the client should extend this class and
 * overwrite the method <code>write(Automata.State)</code>. In such case, it is
 * recommended that <code>super.write(state)</code> is called before writing the
 * supplementary data. In other words, the standard information (i.e. kind and
 * children) for a state comes first, and the supplementary data is placed after
 * that.
