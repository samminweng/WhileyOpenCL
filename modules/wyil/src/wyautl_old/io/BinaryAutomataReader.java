/**
 * <p>
 * Responsible for reading an automaton in a binary format from an input stream.
 * Obviously, it cannot know how to handle the supplementary data that can be
 * provided as part of a state. Therefore, if the automaton may contain states
 * which have supplementary data, the client is expected to deal with this.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> To handle supplementary data, the client should extend this
 * class and overwrite the method <code>readState()</code>. In such case, it is
 * recommended that <code>super.readState()</code> is called before reading the
 * supplementary data. In other words, the standard information (i.e. kind and
 * children) for a state comes first, and the supplementary data is placed after
 * that.
