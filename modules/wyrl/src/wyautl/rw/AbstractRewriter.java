	 * Reduce the upper states of a given automaton as much as possible. The
	 * pivot point indicates the portion of the automaton which is "new" (i.e.
	 * above the pivot) versus that which is "old" (i.e. below the pivot).
	 * States above the pivot are those which need to be reduced, whilst those
	 * below the pivot are considered to be already fully reduced (and therefore
	 * do not need further reducing).
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * This function is used during the application of an inference rule. An
	 * important aspect of this is that the function must indicate whether or
	 * not <i>the original automaton was left after reduction</i>. That is when,
	 * after reduction, all states above the <code>pivot</code> have been
	 * eliminated, but no state below the pivot has. This indicates that the new
	 * states introduced by the inference rule were reduced away leaving an
	 * automaton identical to before the rule was applied. When this happens,
	 * the inference rule has not been successfully applied and we should
	 * continue to search for other rules which can be applied.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The generally accepted strategy for checking whether the original
	 * automaton remains is as follows: firstly, reductions are only applied to
	 * states above the pivot point (which includes the pivot index itself);
	 * secondly, after a reduction is successfully applied all unreachable
	 * states above the pivot are eliminated (to prevent against the continued
	 * reapplication of a reduction rule); thirdly, when the fixed-point is
	 * reached, the automaton is fully compacted. If during the final
	 * compaction, any state below the pivot becomes unreachable, then the
	 * original automaton was not retained; likewise, if after compaction the
	 * number of states exceeds the pivot, then it was not retained either.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param automaton
	 *            The automaton to be reduced.

	 *            this (including the pivot index itself) are eligible for
	 *            reduction; all those below are not.
